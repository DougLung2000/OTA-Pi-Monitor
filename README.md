# OTA-Pi-Monitor
Remotely monitor over-the-air digital TV transmissions with ARM SBCs

These files were used to build the OTA-Pi Monitor to receive TV translator K36OZ. While currently tested only on the Orange Pi 4 LTS, the files should work on other platforms that support the LinuxTV dvbv5 utilities and tsduck (for transport stream analysis). The scripts and channel data files will have to be modified for use with other TV stations.

Additional information and setup instructions will be added later.
